## Module 2 - Text Editors and Linux commands
[Main Page](README.md)

- Text Editors or IDE
  - Text Editors are mainly just to write code using plain text (no formatting). 
They can have code completion, syntax highlighting, eye-strain reducing themes and free versions.
IDE, or Integrated Development Environment, will include a whole suite of applications that complement the Text Editor. They can also a code compiler, debugger and many other options.
  - Common TEs
    * Text Edit or Notepad (come installed on computer) 
    * Text Wrangler/ BB Edit (MAC only)
    * Notepad++ (Windows Only)
    * VSCode
    * Sublime Text
    * Atom
    * Brackets

- Learning Linux

  - The command line can be found in the Terminal (Mac or linux) or SSH client (Windows). It is a way to interact with the computer. It is a text based interface using the keyboard, where a Graphical User Interface (GUI) uses a mouse/mouse pad to click applications. The command line can be more powerful tool for IT professionals.

  - A few common commands in linux are 
    - 'ls'     This lists the fils/directories in your current location.
    - 'pwd'    This prints your working directory or current location.
    - 'cd'     This will change the directory. 

  - Paths, or file locations, can be absolute or relative
    - Absolute locations are the full file location including all folders needed to get to the file. Kind of like your full street address with state and zip code given to someone who lives in another country.
    - Relative location is sort of a shortcut if you are already in that location. Kind of like telling someone in the same neighborhood you live on a certain street. You do not need to say the city, state and zip code since they are from the same ones.

  - Linux is case sensitive, so **file1.txt** is a completely different file from **File1.txt**. This is different from Windows which is not case sensitive.

  - File Extensions between systems
    - Linux ignores file extensions and instead looks into the file to determine if it is text, an image or executable. So example.png in linux could be an executable that opens instead of an image.
    - Windows looks at file extensions to figure out how to open it. So it will open example.png as an image.
