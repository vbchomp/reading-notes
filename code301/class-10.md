## [The JavaScript Call Stack - What It Is and Why It's Necessary](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/understanding-the-javascript-call-stack-861e41ae61d4/)

- What is a ‘call’? A call is when a function is invoked.

- How many ‘calls’ can happen at once? 1.

- What does LIFO mean? Last In First Out

- Draw an example of a call stack and the functions that would need to be invoked to generate that call stack.

- What causes a Stack Overflow? When a function calls itself without an exit point. The browser runs the function until maximum stack call size is reached and throws a stack error. "Maximum call size exceeded"

## [JavaScript error messages && debugging](https://codeburst.io/javascript-error-messages-debugging-d23f84f0ae7c)

- What is a ‘reference error’? This happens when a variable has not been declared yet.

- What is a ‘syntax error’? This happens when you break the rules of syntax, like missing a semicolon or comma.

- What is a ‘range error’? This happens when manipulating objects with length, like setting an array with a negative length.

- What is a ‘type error’? This happens when types of variables are incompatible, like numbers and strings.

- What is a breakpoint? This is a specific spot that the code will stop if certain values are met. 

- What does the word ‘debugger’ do in your code? Creates a breakpoint in code.

## Things I Want To Know More About

- How to make the error functions Ryan was doing in class? How to know where to put them? How to know which errors to throw?

- How to read the Developer Tools better? There are probably youtube videos I can watch. *Time*
