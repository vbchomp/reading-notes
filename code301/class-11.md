## Things I Want To Know More About

- Code review from Thursday night

  Make sure once you clone the server repo, you do *npm i* to install *cors, express, axios, dotenv*

- What exactly does axios do? I know it is middleware. Hexx called it the carrier pigeon that carries the data back. Does it actually store data?

- For starter code, just run, then start fixing the errors one by one.
