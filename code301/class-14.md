- What occured during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer sciene?
  Personal computers came out and were marketed for boys. Games and toys were made to seem like they were boys toys and girls would not understand them.

- Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?
  It matters because they had more exposure to them, knew more about how they worked, had less uncertainty when things went wrong. They were more comfortable, more familiar, which means they had a head start in getting to know the equipment. Even in CF, you say to go over the command line, or terminal. Girls were not afforded the same opportunities as boys.

## [Why Diversity Matters To Your Tech Company](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/2015/07/21/why-diversity-matters-your-tech-company/30419871/)

- When are diversity efforts most successful?
  They are most successful when driven by company leadership.
- Why do diverse companies perform better?
  The teams are smarter and more creative.
- Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.
  When a company has a diverse design team building something, it will include users from hopefully all walks of life. This would allow facial recognition software to work for dark skinned people. Or people with full facial tattoos. Or heart monitors built into watches to work on sleeve tattoos. (I kind of cheated with my examples, as they were from our diversity class.)

## Things I Want To Know More About

- Why is it that guys are so afraid of strong, smart women? Corporate America is afraid of strong, smart non-white men and women.
