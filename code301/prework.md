## Things I Want To Know More About

- How to make components in React?

- How to properly reference in reading or github? I saw the assignment notes said this 'If you utilize any content directly from the reading sources, be sure to identify what you are quoting, and cite the source. Add a link to this new file under the table of contents for this course.' But it is not  a reference for the whole reading notes, it would be for my 301 class. Would it be listed in the 301 TOC? And dow we use APA styling? How do we do this properly? Like for my answer for the characteristics of a component. It's kind of hard not to quote the 8 characteristics directly from the article. Does that need to be referenced?
