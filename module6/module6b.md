## Top 3 Take Aways from Videos
- Computers have come so far from when they were just Thinking Machines
- The amount of wires you have with the electrical signals determines the amount of data you can store (Did not know that!)
- Progamming languages take your text and translate into binary code

## What makes the Thinking Machine a computer?
- Take input
  - Keyboard, mouse, microphone, car data, biometrics
- Store information
  - Memory gets processed and comes back to storage until ready to be output
- Process the information
  - First computers were calculators
- Output the results
  - Text, photos, videos, games, VR, robots

## Binary Data
- Electrical signals change with ons and offs
- Binary is 0 (off) and 1 (on).
- Decimal is 0-9.
- The more wires you have that turn on or off, the more bits you can store

## Circuits and Logic
- Not, And, Or logic 

## CPU, Memory, Input and Output

## Hardware and Software
- HW is the physical stuff that make up computer
  - Circuits, chips, wires, speakers, plugs, etc
- SW is the stuff you don't see
  - Applications, games, code
- Programming languages translate near-english to binary code
