## Chapter 1 on Structure
* HTML tags are containers with info about the items inside the tags
* Tags and elements are commonly used interchangeably
  * An element really encompasses everything from the opening tag to the end of the closing tag
* An attribute is placed in the opening tag and has a name and a value
  * `<p class="family">`

## Chapter 8 on Extra Markup
* :sparkles:
*  Commenting is beneficial to others who read your code after you!!!
  * Commenting also allows you to remember why you did this thing for that reason 3 years from when you wrote it
  * Comments are viewable in the source code by using the following in HTML
    * `<!-- comments go in here -->`
* A few types of markups
  * id attribute assigns unique identity to an element and allows css to work against just that element
  * class attribute assigns several elements to a class and allows css to work against those elements
  * div groups elements together in a block, think lists
  * span groups elements together inline, think TBD
  * iframe is usually maps and other windows cut into page
  * meta element contains page information and is used to supply info about page to search engines
  * escape characters are special codes to enter before characters that have special meaning to programming languages
