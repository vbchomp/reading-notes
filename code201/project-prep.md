  - Dedicated to finish tasks
  - Not afraid to work in group or on own

- Growth Areas
  - Interrupt when excited
  - Distracted easily

  - Negative jokes when frustrated

- Day to Day Ops Cadence
  - 10-15 minute daily standup meeting to discuss any type of coding outside of individual coding
  - Mob coding for the rest of the hour.

## Conflict Plan

- Voting on issues, then bring in mediation if we cannot agree
- Do not foresee the takeover of the project by one of the members
- This group has experiences that the others do not, so we can explain or mob code to help figure out issues
- Members will be directly addressed when not contributing towards the group
- Members will get help from a TA or Ryan after rogue member is directly addressed

## Communication Plan

- Available during class times in Remo, and all day in Slack
- Breaks as needed
- Communicate if we fall behind. Is it a process failure or knowledge gap?
- Weekend communication is same as above
- Everyone has a voice in a group this small
- We have forbidden workfaces at the table!

## Work Plan

- GitFlow
  - After daily standup, merge any unsynced work to ensure all starting on same page
- PR Review workflow
  - 2 persons must review before merge
  - Merge frequency
    - Member branches will be as needed
    - Dev branch will be after complete blocks of code
    - Main branch will be end of day, only working code
