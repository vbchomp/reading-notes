# Class 28 - Component Lifecycle / useEffect()

[<== Main Page](../README.md)
[<== Code 401](../code401/code401.md)

## Readings

- Why do we not need more .html pages in a multi-page React app?

React only needs the index.html to run.

- If we wanted a component to show up on every page, where would we put it and why?
  - Inside the <BrowserRouter />, outside a <Route /> 

- What does routing do with the components that were rendered when a new route is requested

It only renders the components in the new route.

- What does props.children contain?

Contains whatever is included in the opening and closing tags when invoking a component. [What is {this.props.children} and when you should use it?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49706823/what-is-this-props-children-and-when-you-should-use-it)

- How do useState() and this.setState() differ?

setState sets the state objects in class components and useState is a hook in React that can use state without creating a class. [useState() vs setState() - Strings, Objects, and Arrays](https://dev.to/johnstonlogan/react-hooks-barney-style-1hk7)
