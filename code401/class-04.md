## Readings

- Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development

  Modularization, or smaller more manageable code blocks. Developers use TDD so debugging time goes down. Since code blocks are smaller, maintenance is easier. [What are the advantages of test-driven development?](https://fortegrp.com/test-driven-development-benefits/)

- In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?

  When you have something that needs to run either before or after each test in the suite. [What is the difference between `before()` and `beforeEach()`?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21418580/what-is-the-difference-between-before-and-beforeeach)

- What is one downside of Test Driven Development

  Takes 15-30% longer to develop. See advantages reference link.

- Whatâ€™s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?

  "The most important difference between class- and prototype-based inheritance is that a class defines a type which can be instantiated at runtime, whereas a prototype is itself an object instance." [As a JS Developer, This Is What Keeps Me Up at Night](https://www.toptal.com/javascript/es6-class-chaos-keeps-js-developer-up)

- Why REST?

  It is very flexible and can be run with just about any protocol (normally used with HTTP), without having to install libraries or software. [What is a RESTful API?](https://www.mulesoft.com/resources/api/restful-api)

## Vocab

- functional programming, software development using functions and logic.

- object-oriented programming (OOP), software development around objects rather than function.

- class, a blueprint for creating an object in javascript.

- super, calls the parents class

- this, complicated. sometimes global, sometimes class. sometimes, function.

- Test Driven Development (TDD), software development cycle where you write test and only write code when tests fail

- Jest, open source javascript testing framework

- Continuous Integration (CI), means merging developers' working branches multiple times a day, so it is small workable chunks rather than one big merge of their work.

- REST, Representational State Transfer, It is very flexible and can be run with just about any protocol (normally used with HTTP), without having to install libraries or software.

- Data Model, organizes elements of data and shows how they relate to each other.
