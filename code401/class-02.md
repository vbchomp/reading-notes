## Readings

- What’s the difference between PUT and PATCH?

  A PUT request will send all the fields and a PATCH will only send the fields that need to be updated. [Difference Between PUT and PATCH Request](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-put-and-patch-request/)

- Provide links to 3 services or tools that allow you to “mock” an API for development like json-server

  [Mock API Server Online Testing & API Mocking Guide](https://stoplight.io/mock-api-guide/basics/)
  [API Mocking and Virtualization](https://swagger.io/solutions/mocking-and-virtualization/)
  [Mocking API calls with Jest](https://www.loupetestware.com/post/mocking-api-calls-with-jest)

- Compare and contrast Swagger and APIDoc.js [Which tool to choose for API docs — my recommendations](https://idratherbewriting.com/learnapidoc/pubapis_which_tool_to_choose.html) [npm trends](https://www.npmtrends.com/apidoc-vs-apidoc-swagger-vs-swagger) [apiDocjs vs Swagger Inspector](https://stackshare.io/stackups/apidocjs-vs-swagger-inspector)

  I'm thinking APIDOC.js is the better option from these sites.

- Which HTTP status codes should be sent with each type of (un)successful API call?

  100s are Informational
  200s are Successes
  300s are Redirects
  400s are Client Errors
  500s are Server Errors

- Compare and contrast SOAP and ReST [SOAP vs REST. What's the Difference?](https://smartbear.com/blog/soap-vs-rest-whats-the-difference/) 
  
  Representational State Transfer is a set of guidelines that are more flexible and can be used to more easily than SOAP.

  Simple Object Access Protocol is a more complicated protocol and uses XML.
