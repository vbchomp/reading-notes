# Class 12b - Socket.io

[<== Main Page](../README.md)
[<== Code 401](../code401/code401.md)

## Readings

- What is the benefit of transforming data into packets? Less chance of data loss at the end point when sending large amounts of data. 

- UDP is often refereed to as a connectionless protocol. Why is this? It does not matter if the connection is up or not, if server receives the data or not, UDP is sending it. Where TCP has to have an acknowledgement that it's up and receiving after each packet. "Haplessly remembered from Sec+ training."

- Can a socket server application have multiple socket connections? Yes.

- Can a socket connection application be connected to multiple socket servers? No. 

- Can an application be both a socket server and a socket connection? I would say it can host both, so yes.
