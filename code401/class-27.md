## Readings

- How does React differ from vanilla JS/HTML/CSS?

  - React requires components, JS does not
  - React apps start with a blank HTML page and dynamically create the initial state in JS, where JS creates the initial UI on the server in HTML
  - React automatically updates UI based on setting and changing state in the components, JS finds the DOM nodes and manually appends or removes elements

- What is the primary difference between a function component and a class component?

  - functional component accepts props as arguments and returns React elements, does not have a render method. Class components need to extend from React component and needs a render function.
