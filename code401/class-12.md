## Readings

- Why is access control important? It follows the least-privilege principle. This is a security principle that says a person can only access the lowest access that they need to do their job. They do not need to have root level privileges to create a table in a database. However, someone might become a victim of coercion or become an inside threat if given too much access.

- Describe an application that would need access control. A database that controls personnel and pay information.

- What is a role used for? To differentiate at what levels users can view and manipulate data in systems.

- Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control? Roles are centrally managed and can be used in security groups, where DAC is set on objects like files and MAC is normally set by the organization and you normally have no control over who has access. RBAC can be scaled up or down based on the groups. [Role-Based Access Control](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/role-based-access-control)

## Vocab

- Authorization allows you access to parts of a system based on what job or role you have been assigned.

- Role Based Access Control assigns your access based on what role you are assigned in the company to prevent role over-reach. [Role-based access control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control)

- Capabilities are the assignments that users can do based on the roles or jobs they are assigned, like create a table or delete a user. [Capability-based security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability-based_security)
