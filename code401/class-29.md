## Readings

  - If you want to run an effect and clean it up only once (on mount and unmount), you can pass an empty array ( [] ) as a second argument. [Using the Effect Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html)

- Can ```useState()``` update more than one state variable at the same time?

  - To store multiple values in useState, you have to put them into a single object. [How to update multiple state at once using react hook react.js](https://pretagteam.com/question/how-to-update-multiple-state-at-once-using-react-hook-reactjs)

- Is ```useState()``` synchronous?

  - useState and setState both are asynchronous.,They do not update the state immediately but have queues that are used to update the state object. [Is useState synchronous?](https://pretagteam.com/question/is-usestate-synchronous-duplicate)
