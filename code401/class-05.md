## Vocab

Linked List - A data structure that contains nodes that links/points to the next node in the list.

Singly - Singly refers to the number of references the node has. A Singly linked list means that there is only one reference, and the reference points to the Next node in a linked list.

Doubly - Doubly refers to there being two (double) references within the node. A Doubly linked list means that there is a reference to both the Next and Previous node.

Node - Nodes are the individual items/links that live in a linked list. Each node contains the data for each link.

Next - Each node contains a property called Next. This property contains the reference to the next node.

Head - The Head is a reference of type Node to the first node in a linked list.

Current - The Current is a reference of type Node to the node that is currently being looked at. When traversing, you create a new Current variable at the Head to guarantee you are starting from the beginning of the linked list.
